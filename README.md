Hello.

This is a quick theme file for Music On Console (MOC) that you can simply copy and paste in your `/home/username/.moc/themes/` directory in orter to have this 
theme available.

For it to work, use `mocp -T bpc-theme` in your terminal (assuming you have pasted "bpc-theme" in the previously mentioned directory) or set it as default in your config. 
I am having trouble finding config files for several apps but if i find them I will add some quick instructions for that aswell.

Feel free to edit this theme, most of the default ones are pretty ugly -due respect to MOC- so I would highly suggest you do that.

I managed to get a cyberpunk-ish style though I was looking more for a black-pink style. It came out pretty decent IMO and it's a popular color scheme.
